                    <h3>The Adventure So Far... üèîÔ∏è</h3>
                    <p>I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist with a passion for collaborating with business partners to design machine-learning models and AI-driven solutions that enhance product offerings and empower data-driven decision-making. 

                        What sets me apart is my dual expertise in data science and education. Before transitioning into tech, I was an interdisciplinary teacher, education administrator, and designer with a focus on reimagining mathematics education. My background in educational technology and curriculum development has given me a unique skill set: the ability to craft compelling data stories that resonate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I bridge the gap between data and decision-makers, ensuring that everyone‚Äîfrom C-suite executives to frontline teams‚Äîcan harness the power of data in their work. Whether I‚Äôm optimizing an industry classification model, conducting academic research to guide model development, designing interactive tools for client management, or presenting at a conference, my focus is always on creating data solutions that are both impactful and understandable.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm currently a computer science and machine learning graduate student at Cornell University's Cornell Tech campus in NYC, and my prior roles in tech included Data Scientist positions at Middesk and BlockFi. A proud graduate of Hampshire College, I first moved to New York after graduating with a
                        degree in educational technology and mathematics curriculum development. As an educator, I've taught and worked at CITYterm at the Masters School, New York Univeristy, L!FE Leaders and with private students in one-on-one tutoring. A longtime lover of theater, I have also worked professionally in props and scenic design in New York and regionally, including working on productions on Broadway and at such institutions as Ars Nova, the Drama League of New York, Williamstown Theater Festival, Abrons Arts Center, White Plains PAC, TADA! Youth Theater and more.
